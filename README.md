# PyILP
A novel user-friendly Python/Jupyter interface for Inductive Logic programming(ILP)  system for teaching relational machine learning and comparing different algorithms.

We have incoperated two different ILP algorithms in this packge
1) Aleph
2) Metagol

# Aleph
Aleph is an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system developed by Ashwin Srinivasan: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/

In this package we use a porting of Aleph v.5 to SWI-Prolog prepared by Fabrizio Riguzzi: https://github.com/friguzzi/aleph

# Metagol
Metagol is an Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) system maintained by Andrew Cropper: https://github.com/metagol/metagol

# Requirements
[SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

[pyswip](https://pypi.org/project/pyswip/)
